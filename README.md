# MultiplePictureBox
A very simple image container with prev/next buttons written sometime between the Cambrian and Ordovician eras, so don't expect much. I made a couple minor updates recently because I reused this in another project. 

See my skaa_editor repository for the latest version (eliminated buttons in favor of left/right click and added a simple zoom capability).

The "Captioned" version hasn't been updated or used since it was written. You'd be better of just adding a caption yourself to the non-captioned one.
